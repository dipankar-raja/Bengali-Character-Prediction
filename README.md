# Bengali-Character-Prediction
Bengali script recognition presents unique challenges due to its extensive character set and varied
handwriting styles. This manuscript introduces an innovative methodology to address these challenges,
proposing a standard model design utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN). The training and
testing dataset encompasses 12,000 grayscale Bengali character images for training and 2,997 for tes-
ting, all uniformly resized to a standardized pixel size of 40 × 40. The CNN model’s architecture is
visually depicted through Visual Keras properties, offering insight into its structure. Comprehensive evaluations of the proposed model reveal exceptional performance, attaining an impressive training accuracy
of 0.9994166493415833 (99.94 %) and a validation accuracy of 0.9623655676841736 (96.24 %). The model
yields exemplary outcomes, showcasing a Test Loss of 0.0038. These outcomes underscore the model’s
capacity to significantly advance Bengali character recognition, thus contributing profoundly to optical
character recognition systems and language processing in Bengali. This research introduces novel prospects for enhancing handwriting recognition systems, enabling seamless integration of Bengali language
processing technologies across diverse domains. By adeptly addressing the nuances of the Bengali script,
the proposed model opens pathways for elevated language processing applications and nurtures the evolution of more sophisticated optical character recognition systems.
